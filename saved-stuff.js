          <p>A team of 3 others and I had two weeks to fully plan and build this webapp. With only a few weeks of prior JS and full stack development experience, I was able to play a crucial role in my team and build core features for our website. This includes a fully functional globe-map on the homepage.

          <p>A childhood friend of mine in his recent years was diagnosed with a rare disease that impaired most of his vision. He is still working out what he can and cannot do, but he continues to surprise everyone around him with what he can accomplish. That is until we tried playing Minecraft together. He struggled to read what was in his inventory and craft items he had previously known. Minecraft's native accessibility features did not aid his problems, which was suprising and made me mad. I decided to learn java and within a few hours I had made a plugin that read out every item he clicked on. His diamonds continue to stack up.</p>
